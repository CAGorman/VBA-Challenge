# VBA-Challenge
Module 2 Challenge
This repository includes:
    Mod2_VBA.vbs -- The VBA code for the project
    MOD2_VBA_Screenshot -- A screenshot of the Worksheet for corresponding code
    
There a few issues worth mentioning, since I was unable to complete all of tasks:
    I was not able to run code for the Table with "Greatest % Increase", "Greatest % Decrease" and "Greatest Total Volume". I included a few attempts I made at the Greatest % Increase code, which is located at the bottom of the vbs file. The teacher was unable to find the issue with the code.
    I also was unable to correctly code to copy the VBA code to all of the other worksheets in the Workbook. 
    And finally- in the "Percent Change" column- I only ran the loop for a section of the data (For i = 2 to 1500). I attempted with both Dim i as double and Dim i as long. Despite it working for the smaller set, it would not populate the entire set when I ran it. The TA was also stumped with that.
    
Your feedback would be greatly appreciated- as I am hoping to re-submit later.
